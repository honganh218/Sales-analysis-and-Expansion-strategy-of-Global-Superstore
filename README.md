## INSIGHTS
<br> **1. Overall:**
<br>
<br>- Revenue has grown 17.46% annually from 2011-2014.
<br>- Orders increased 1.7 times in 2014, resulting in revenue growth.
<br>
<br> **2. Location:**
<br>- The top five regions with the highest orders, revenue, and profit are **APAC**(3.6M)>**EU**(2.9M)> **US**(2.3M)>**LATAM**(2.2M)> **Africa**(0.8M). 
<br>- Noteworthy, Africa's figures are only half of the other regions -> big gap between TOP4 and TOP5 market
<br>
<br> **3. Product:**
<br>- **Technology** is the best-selling industry and generates **nearly 1/3 of total revenue**
<br>- **Copiers** being the most profitable product *(12% of total revenue)*
<br>- **Blinders** are the best-selling product in terms of **quantity**
<br>
<br> **4. Segment:**
<br>- More than half of the customers are **individual consumers** (51.48%) -> most profitable customer segment
<br>
<br> **5. Return rate:**
<br>- The return rate is **2.29%** , divided equally among LATAM, APAC, US, and EU.
<br>- **Binders** are the most returned item.
<br>- The return rate has significantly dropped from 13% (2011) to 6.7% (2014) -> positive trend highlighted
<br> => **indicating an improvement in customer satisfaction and product quality**
<br>
<br> **6. Profit and Revenue:**
<br>- Both profit and revenue are trending up -> This indicates positive growth and suggests that the company is performing well. 
## RECOMMENDATIONS
<br> **1. Potential market: Canada**
<br>- Curent profit rate: 27%
<br>- Profit margin: 27% (significantly high)
<br>=> 2 best indicators are high and potential to invest more
<br> **2. Product**
<br>- All three segments: Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture, have high profit margins => investing in all three segments could be beneficial.
<br> However, based on profit rate, the suggestion is to invest first in **Technology** and **Office Supplies**, and then in **Furniture** later.
<br>- Within **Technology segment**, potential products are **Phones, Copiers, and Accessories**( profit margins ranging from approximately 27% to 35%)
<br>- Within **Office Supplies**, **Storage** is identified as the most potential product, with highest sales(8%) and profitability(~10%)
<br>- Additionally, there is potential in developing more Envelope, Fasteners, and Labels, which are three products with high profit margins( 17%, 14% and 21% respectively)
<br> **3. Return rate:**
<br> The return rate is decreasing, which is considered a positive signal. This indicates that the number of returns is reducing over time.
<br> It is recommended to check the shipping quality for single binders (most returned items), as long-distance transportation may be causing mold and product damage. Customers are advised to use the Same Day package option to mitigate this issue.
